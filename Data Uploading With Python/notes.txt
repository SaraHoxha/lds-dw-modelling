# Handle exceptions:
    (done)# - Check if the csv files exist
    (done)# - Check if the csv files are not empty
    (done)# - Check if the csv files have the correct primary key
    # - More to be added

(done)#Check if the table already exists in the database and if its the same as not to populate it again and continue with the next table.

(done)#Change utils check_csv_files function to match only the files that we have in our schema.

(done)#I need to find a way to not  write K sql commands (one) for each row, this can be optimized to run 1k lines per sql query.

Create another py code to define the constraints on the tables (primary keys and foreign keys after tables already loaded)
