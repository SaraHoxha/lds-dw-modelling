# Handle exceptions:
    # - Check if the csv files exist
    # - Check if the csv files are not empty
    # - Check if the csv files have the correct primary key
    # - Check if the csv files have the correct foreign key
    # - More to be added

#Check if the table already exists in the database and if its the same as not to populate it again and continue with the next table.

#Check the file_path of the DW_csv_files folder in uploading python file.

#Change utils check_csv_files function to match only the files that we have in our schema.

#I need to find a way to not  write K sql commands (one) for each row, this can be optimized to run 1k lines per sql query.

#Implement loop, remember where it starts and where it ends.

#Check if I need to reset the cursor and the connection after each table or not.
