### columns to remove
- street direction
- LATITUDE, LONGITUDE and LOCATION (REMOVING BECAUSE BEAT_OF_OCCURRENCE INTEGRATES THEM ALL)

### columns to aggregate
- INJURIES_FATAL
- INJURIES_INCAPACITATING
- INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING
- INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT
- INJURIES_NO_INDICATION
- INJURIES_UNKNOWN
after aggregating those INJURIES_TOTAL would be remvoed

the values in all those features space in values in weird ways but i would propose to aggregate all the values in them into one single value for each type and put them into a scale to keep an order for them

so maybe we would have
- INJURIES_UNKNOWN 0
- INJURIES_NO_INDICATION 1
- INJURIES_REPORTED_NOT_EVIDENT 2
- INJURIES_NON_INCAPACITATING 3
- INJURIES_INCAPACITATING 4
- INJURIES_FATAL 5

-------------------------

'CRASH_DATE' is an aggregation of: 'CRASH_HOUR', 'CRASH_DAY_OF_WEEK', 'CRASH_MONTH'?

-------------------------

can STREET_NAME and STREET_NO be in 1 field?
